# BankTron
Personal budget and spend tracking tool.

This app also functions as a sandbox for developing my C# skills and testing out new concepts as I learn them.

TODO:
- Finish Budget Object creation and write to SQLite database
- Create a view that compares a Budget to the actual transactions in the database over a set period of time
- Create reports to filter transactions (ex: Answer questions like "How much did I spend on my car last year?")  
- Replace quick and ugly win forms GUI with WPF (resuse data and busniess logic projects to test separation of concerns)
